  Again,  I learned by following the stages on codecademy, and advancing through the levels. This time, however, I used the 'solution button more frequently than I should have, because I kept making mistakes that I shoudn't have (such as spelling, not putting a colon at the end of definitions/loops, or accidentally using the wrong bracket). I checked after the window threw an error, but I didn't see the missing letter/colon.

    Carrying on from the box above, this time I will check for the small mistakes aswell as the bigger ones, and trying not to use the 'solution' button too much. I also will try not to make bigger mistakes, such as not putting brackets at all, or not using the correct code (eg. using def instead of for).

   Next time I will look for the mistakes more quickly (and look for the small ones too), and try not to make the same mistakes.
