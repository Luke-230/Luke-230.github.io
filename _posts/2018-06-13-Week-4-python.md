    As we had just come back from half term, I forgot how to do some of the coding. This caused many problems because I had to use the 'solution' button more than I intended to, but after about 10 to 15 minutes I got the hang of it again, allowing me to carry on with my work in he usual fashion. Another minor problem that I had was that the keyboard's settings were changes to US keyboard, meaning that @ and " were switched. Howevery, this didn't bother me too much, and I eventually changed it back to UK Keyboard.
