   this time, I learned from myipad when I took the videos, but because I filmed it at an angle, the circuiting still wasn't very clear. This caused me to try to set up the second circuit for three quarters of the remaining time of the lesson. In the end, I still managed to finish the second task, although I was a bit slow. this is proof of what I did:<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Im1RSZSrat7oYyFL871IvGXoXGfH5GaJ/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe>

    Again, it still took me three quarters of the lesson to set up the breadboard because the picture(s) weren't clear. To prevent that from happening again, I took a clear picture from above this time, to avoid confusion next lesson. However, the circuits may be completely different from the previous two circuits, as there are only two GPIO ground sockets.

    Next time I will look at the clearer photo that I took of the breadboard, and follow it accordingly.
