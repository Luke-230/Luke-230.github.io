<table><tr><th>My Summary Post</th></tr></table>

<table><tr><th>Github</th><td>-First term</td></tr>
<tr><th>Difficulty (out of 10)</th><td>I would give Github a 3/10 (10 being the most difficult) because the colours and the background were fairly easy, but the containers and the corners were a bit harder.</td></tr>
<tr><th>What did you like about github?</th><td>I liked that </td></tr>
<tr><th>.<td>What didn't you like?</th>I didn't like the fact that you had to create a post every week, and I personally think it should be every 2 weeks</td></tr>

<table><tr><th>Scratch</th><td>-Second term</td></tr>
<tr><th>Difficulty (out of 10)</th><td>I think scratch was 6/10, at the level that I was coding. The movement and pictures were easy, but some of the coding was a bit difficult.</td></tr>
<tr><th>What did you like about scratch?</th><td>I liked that we could experiment with our code. </td></tr>
<tr><th>What didn't you like?</th><td>I didn't like the amount of time we got, because I didn't have enough time, although everyone else did.</td></tr>

<table><tr><th>Prezi & E-Saftey</th><td>-Third term</td></tr>
<tr><th>Difficulty (out of 10)</th><td></td>I give Prezi 2/10 because it wasn't really hard, as if you did enough research everything would go well.</tr>
<tr><th>What did you like about Prezi?</th><td>I liked that it was a more fun version of powerpoint and you can experiment with what you do.</td></tr>
<tr><th>What didn't you like?</th><td>Like in scratch, I found that I didn't have enough time, nor did my classmates, although I managed to finish it in time (barely!)</td></tr>
