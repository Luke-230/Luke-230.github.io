    <td>I learnt by following the instrucions on the manual that I was given, and reading all the information that I was given.</td>

    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My FUZE box wasn't working, so I tried using a different one. That one didn't work either, so I tried to use a different power cable. It turned out that both FUZE boxes weren't working, because I used a third one and it worked fine.This limited my learning as the time it took to set up was very long, and I feel like I could have done 1.4 aswell.

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will set up as quickly as possible, and getting things done faster, as I only completed 1 task in the lesson. I will also try to get my blog to work (and now it does, as you are reading it right now).</td>
