  <th>Game</th><th> Sprites, variables and what I think about the games</th>

</table>

<table>
<tr><th>Pac man:</th>
<td>In this game I noticed that there are 6 sprites, Pac-man, the 4 ghosts 
(Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde)the indivisual pellets(I'm counting them as one)and the power pellets.
The variables I noticed are the lives, the points, and the cherries. I think that the game is good in the way that
the ghosts don't follow Pac-man, but I think it should be a bit more randomised.
</tr>
<tr><th>Space invaders:</th>
<td>In this game I noticed there are 4 different sprites: the Aliens, the tank, the bullet and the shields/bunkers.
The vairiables I noticed are the lives, points, and possibly speed..I think this game is good that the aliens speed up the more time you take,
but I think that they should have multiple bullet sprites for the tank instad of just 1.</td></tr>
<tr><th>Frogger:></th>
<td>The different sprites I noticed in this game were: frogger, the cars, the turtles and the logs. The variables were:
the score, the high score, and the time.I think that this game is good, but I think frogger should go a little slower.</td></tr>
<tr><th>Asteroids:</th>
<td>the sprites I noticed in this game were the asteroids, the spaceship, the enemy spaceship and the bullets.
The variables are : the score and the lives. This game could improve by having better controls (not just the up arrow for 
moving, and the left and right arrows for turning, but all the arrows for a boost that way and the a and d keys for turning.</td></tr>
<tr><th> Arkanoid </th>
<td> In this game, I found 4 sprites: you, the ball, the bricks and the power - ups. The variables are: the score, the type of power up,
the highscore and the lives. this game is good that it has power ups, but it could have more different types of bricks.</td></tr>
<tr><th>Donkey kong></th>
<td>This game has a lot of sprites, which are : the normal barrels, the blue barrels, donkey kong, the princess, the rails
that you walk on, the ladders, the hammers,the oil barrel and the fire monsters. The variables are : the score, the highscore and the lives.
I think that this game is good beacause of the things you can get.</td></tr>
<tr><th>Tetris</th>
<td>Thereis only 1 type of sprite in tetris- the blocks- but it doesn't mean there is only one sprite.the vairiables are the level, the score
and the lines. I think thios game is good beacause it only uses 1 type of sprite, but is still a game.</td></tr>
<tr><th>Chuckie egg</th>
<td>In this game there are 5 sprites, you, the mother chicken, the ostriches, the eggs and the piles. The variables are: score, player, bonus,level
and time. This game could be better if the ostriches were less randomised.</td></tr>
<tr><th>Galaga</th>
<td> In this game the sprites are: the enemies, the bullets and the fighter capturer thing. The variables are the lives and score.
what I liked about it was that the bullets had a trail effect.</td></tr>
<tr><th>Centipede</th>
<td> In this game I have noticed 5 types of sprites, which are: you, the centipede, the mushroom things, the bullets and the spiders.
The variables are: the score, the highscore and possibly speed, although we can't see it. This game is good because the centipede speeds
ip at the end.</td></tr>
