    This week, I learned from Rex, becuase he helped me set up the breadboard, wires, resistors and LEDs. It then worked fine: <iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/18RhNeYJobNc8-Q41rCHbTN89pp3pLjaF/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe>, but when adding a second wire I got confused again, and so did everyone else in the class that had got onto this stage.

    Although Rex helped me, I tried to set it up myself in the beggining, for about a third or a half of the lesson. This slowed me down significantly. Next time I will set up more quickly, by looking on the photo I took with my Ipad, because the one on the manual wasn't very clear. However, I won't fully understand how to do the second part at first, but I will figure that out during the lesson.

    Next time I will follow the instructions on the manual a bit more carefully, and I will have more time to do things differently.
