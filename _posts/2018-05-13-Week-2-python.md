   I learned by following the stages on codecademy, and advancing through the levels. I also tried not to use the 'show solution' button, as I have found it to be less helpful in helping me remember how to code and how to use python syntax. It also helped that I could have dived straigt in to codecadamy, because it helped me get through a lot more this time.

  This time, I had an error message that showed up, and I couldn't pass that stage. I ended up using the 'show solution' button, and, it turns out I accidentally wrote 'print' instead of 'return'. This took up about 10 to 15 minuted of the lesson, which is a lot of time. I will try not to do the same mistake next time by being more careful and checking for mistakes like this next time an error pops up.
