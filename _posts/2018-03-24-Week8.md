   This time I, again, followed the instructuions on the maual aswell as lookingat the pictures on my ipad. The birds eye view pictures helped a lot this time, as I managed to get past two stages of work this time: <iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1agGpoyKx8QTCE5RL2Db5jgZAvB3CHAzb/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe><iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P2gcG14PNxOzDnFH7rDXU6KddfKO-7kK/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe>.

   As I've said before, the pictures on my ipad from the top helped me a lot, and Ethan and Oskar helped a bit when setting up the first video. Ethan also helped me film the second video, because I have no partner. The pictures on the manual for the second video was also much clearer. This helped me move much quicker, and work much more efficiently.
