  <tr>
    <td>
   I learned by following the stages on codecademy, and advancing through the levels. I also didn't use the 'show solution' button, as I have found it to be less helpful in helping me remember how to code and how to use python syntax.

    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
  The only thing that limited my learning this time was the fact that I had to create an account, which still only took less than a minute. 
   </td>

    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
   Next time I will try to work more efficiently aswell as effectively - like when I worked on the FUZE boxes.
